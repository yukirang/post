I remember when I was taking the elementary CS courses during my undergrad, the concept of "full-stack development" is not as popular as nowadays, let alone the idea of "full-stack programming language". But as time goes by, the arisen of Node has totally changed the situation of web development. With "node", a traditional front-end developer is able to touch the tip of the iceberg without even learning a new language. Interesting, isn't it?

<strong>So what is Node? </strong>

The <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">official</a> explanation is
<blockquote> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on <a href="https://developers.google.com/v8/">Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine</a>.</blockquote>
Well, that seems confusing to me. I've made some searches and here's what I learned:

Previously all the JavaScript code had to run in a browser.  This unique property has kept  JavaScript a front-end language for several years, and prevent it from starting a relationship with the server side world. But the birth of Node has broken through the barrier, making JavaScript able to be a server-side language.  Recent years have seen the huge development of Node, even with a new title of "Nodejs developer" becoming very popular. And the Node Package Manager (NPM) has become the world's largest software registry and open source library.

I feel like even if I'm much passioned on front-end development, mastering node is still an important and urging challenge to overcome:)

One principle of the development of things is that new elements will always be taking the places of the old ones. For me, in the web development area, this process seems especially fast. In 2018 the founder of nodejs has introduced a new Typescript V8 runtime called "deno", and has already reached more than 27k stars on GitHub. What changes it may bring to the environment is worth paying attention to.
